# marin - Discord A.I. conversational bot
Context: While digging through and cleaning my old computer's file, came across my old discord bot that I wrote back in 2018. Naturally - I feel obligate to boot it back up, patch bugs and have it up and running with an A.I. model, the only natural thing to do. Now, this baby is 727% better than 16 year old Jasper's bot, suck it young self!!!

## [Model](https://github.com/wluxie/DialoGPT-medium-marin/tree/master/DialoGPT-data)
- Used [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium) as a host training repo
- Data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Trained using Microsoft [DialoGPT conversational model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium) (microsoft / DialoGPT-medium)
- Structure: `model_train_upload_workflow.ipyb`: Notebook to be run in Google Colab to train and upload the model to Hugging Face's Model Hub
